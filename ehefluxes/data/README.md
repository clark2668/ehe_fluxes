# List of Models

The files in this directory contain the flux models.
They are broken down by "cosmogenic" an "source" models.
Where "source" models refer to EHE/UHE flux predictions
where neutrinos are produced within a source.
The "cosmogenic" models specifically refer to neutrinos
produced in flight via interactions with the CMB and EBL.

The header of each file contains detailed bibliographic information
about the source of that model.
This includes the paper authors and title, links to the paper, etc.

In all flux files, energy units are GeV, flux units are 1/GeV/cm2/s/sr.
Each column gives the flux per species.
See the main README.md fo more information.
